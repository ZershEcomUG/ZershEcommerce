                                <p>As we've earleir assured you, you can make your profit with Zersh from day one for as low as possible. The registration and listing fee is totaly free. You also don't incur any monthly or annual charges. The only charge you're incurring by selling with Zersh is just 10% off every sale you make</p>

                                <figcaption>What do I need to set up my store on Zersh?</figcaption>
                                <p>It’s very easy to set up your own shop on Zersh. Create your Zersh Account, if you don't have one yet, set your shop location, choose a shop name, provide all the requested legal documents and details, set a payment method (how you want to be paid), and finally set a billing method (how you want to pay your Zersh fees). When everything is done, you can now list your products</p>

                                <figcaption>So how do I get paid on Zersh? (How can I get my 'ka' money?)</figcaption>
                                <p>Once a sale is made and the charges are deducted, your money will be deposited on your account using your preffered payment that you selected in the registration of your seller accouunt and store. </p>
                                <p>For those sellers who opt to use paypal for payments, we encourage you to use a PayPal Business account and not a Personal account, as personal accounts are subject to monthly receiving limits and cannot accept payments from buyers that are funded by a credit card.</p>

                                <figcaption>What happens after a customer has ordered for my product in Zersh?</figcaption>
                                <p>The Zersh team will process the order, reach out to you concerning the order details and then confirm the order with the customer. Our team can package the product after receiving it from you and our delivery agents will deliver the product to the customer.</p>
